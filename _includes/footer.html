This site is based on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to produce html pages from markdown posts.
Jekyll is integrated in <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> and this is where these pages are hosted.
The styling is based on <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap toolkit</a>, extended by <a href="https://hackerthemes.com/bootstrap-themes/hello-world/">hackerthemes</a> and its open source "Hello world" theme.
